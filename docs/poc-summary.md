# SMCP Proof of Concept Summary

SMCP is a proof-of-concept for the world's first enterprise-grade, multi-tenant hosting platform specifically designed
for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It addresses critical security vulnerabilities and infrastructure complexity
challenges in the rapidly evolving development ecosystem. The platform leverages a revolutionary 5-layer security
architecture built on Cloudflare's global edge network, featuring industry-first AI-generated code security controls
alongside traditional network, application, runtime, and data protection layers.

SMCP uses the latest MCP Streamable HTTP transport protocol for bidirectional communication, enabling
zero-configuration auto-scaling and sub-100ms global latency through 300+ edge locations. Currently completing Phase 1
(Discovery & Planning), the project has validated technical feasibility, completed comprehensive architecture design,
and established detailed security strategies, including OAuth 2.1 compliance and V8 isolate-based tenant separation.

The platform delivers enterprise-grade security without complexity, global scalability from development to production,
and cost-effective hosting (~$6/month POC scale, ~$34/month production scale). It positions SMCP as the foundational
infrastructure for the next generation of secure AI-powered development tools and establishes a pathway to a
comprehensive, vetted marketplace ecosystem.
