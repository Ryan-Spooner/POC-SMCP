# .augment-guidelines
# Defines rules and context management for the AI assistant in this workspace.
# Version: 1.0

# --- Rule Priority ---
# Ensures these workspace-specific rules take precedence over any global settings.
rule_priority:
  description: "These Workspace AI Rules override any conflicting global or system rules."
  precedence: ABSOLUTE # Workspace rules are final.

# --- Memory System ---
# Configures the file-based memory bank used by the AI for context persistence.
memory_system:
  type: memory-bank # Specifies the type of memory system.
  directory: ./memory-bank # Relative path to the directory storing memory files.

  # Core Files: Key documents the AI should be aware of and potentially update.
  core_files:
    productContext: productContext.md   # High-level project goals, features, architecture.
    activeContext: activeContext.md    # Current focus, recent changes, open questions.
    progress: progress.md            # Task tracking (completed, current, backlog).
    decisionLog: decisionLog.md        # Log of significant technical decisions.
    systemPatterns: systemPatterns.md  # Recurring code patterns, architectural choices, style guides.
    dependencies: dependencies.md      # Technology stack, versions, and dependency decisions.
    meetings: meetings.md             # Meeting notes, discussions, and action items.
    troubleshooting: troubleshooting.md # Common issues, solutions, and debugging guides.

  # Update Strategy: Defines how the AI should modify core files.
  # Options: APPEND (add to end), REPLACE_SECTION (find header, replace content below it), OVERWRITE (replace entire file).
  # Note: The AI should use judgment; e.g., 'APPEND' to logs, 'REPLACE_SECTION' for dynamic states.
  update_strategies:
    productContext.md: APPEND # Product context generally evolves by adding info.
    activeContext.md: REPLACE_SECTION # Current focus/changes usually replace previous state. Use ## headers as anchors.
    progress.md: APPEND # Append completed tasks, discovered items. Current tasks might need section replacement.
    decisionLog.md: APPEND # Always append new decisions chronologically.
    systemPatterns.md: APPEND # Add new patterns or refine existing ones (manual edit might be better for refinement).
    dependencies.md: APPEND # Add new dependencies and update existing entries as needed.
    meetings.md: APPEND # Always append new meeting notes chronologically.
    troubleshooting.md: APPEND # Add new issues and solutions as they are discovered.

  # Initial Content Templates: Defines the structure if files need creation.
  # These are primarily for reference; an initialization script should handle actual creation.
