#### Issue: Dependency Installation Failures
**Symptoms:**
- Package installation fails
- Version conflicts
- Missing dependencies

**Common Causes:**
- Node version mismatch
- Cache corruption
- Network issues
- Platform-specific dependencies

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Clear package manager cache
npm cache clean --force
# or
yarn cache clean

# Delete node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Check Node version
node --version
nvm use [required-version]
```

**Prevention:**
- Use .nvmrc file for Node version consistency
- Commit lock files to repository
- Document system requirements clearly

### Build & Deployment Issues

#### Issue: Build Failures
**Symptoms:**
- Build process stops with errors
- Missing assets in build output
- Environment variable issues

**Common Solutions:**
```bash
# Clean build
npm run clean
npm run build

# Check environment variables
echo $NODE_ENV
printenv | grep [PROJECT_PREFIX]

# Verbose build for debugging
npm run build -- --verbose
```

**Debugging Steps:**
1. Check build logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed
4. Check for file path issues (case sensitivity)
