  # Note: The AI should use judgment; e.g., 'APPEND' to logs, 'REPLACE_SECTION' for dynamic states.

    decisionLog.md: APPEND # Always append new decisions chronologically.
    systemPatterns.md: APPEND # Add new patterns or refine existing ones (manual edit might be better for refinement).

  # Initial Content Templates: Defines the structure if files need creation.
  # These are primarily for reference; an initialization script should handle actual creation.
