# Decision Log

**Decision:**
* Use HTTP Transport Only for MCP Server Implementation on Cloudflare Workers

**Rationale:**
* stdio transport is incompatible with Cloudflare Workers (no subprocess support)
* HTTP transport provides full MCP protocol compatibility
* Streamable HTTP with SSE enables real-time communication
* Aligns with Cloudflare Workers' HTTP-first architecture
* Enables global edge deployment and auto-scaling benefits

**Context/Trigger:**
* SMCP-001-01 research revealed MCP supports two transport mechanisms
* Cloudflare Workers runtime constraints eliminate stdio option
* Need to establish viable technical path for MCP hosting POC

**Implementation Notes:**
* Focus on Streamable HTTP transport implementation
* Use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming capabilities
* Implement session management via Mcp-Session-Id headers
* Leverage Cloudflare KV for session storage
* Skip stdio compatibility entirely to avoid complexity
