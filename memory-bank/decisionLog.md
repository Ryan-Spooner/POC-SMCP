**Decision:**
* Adopt V8 Isolate-Based Multi-Tenant Architecture with 4-Layer Security Model

**Rationale:**
* V8 isolates provide robust runtime isolation between tenant MCP servers
* 4-layer security (Network, Application, Runtime, Data) ensures comprehensive protection
* Worker-level isolation prevents cross-tenant access and resource conflicts
* Storage namespace isolation (KV prefixes, R2 buckets) maintains data separation
* Cloudflare's native auto-scaling eliminates need for custom scaling logic

**Context/Trigger:**
* SMCP-001-03 architecture design required defining multi-tenant hosting approach
* Need to balance security, performance, and operational simplicity
* Must leverage Cloudflare Workers' strengths while mitigating limitations

**Implementation Notes:**
* Each tenant gets dedicated Worker instance with isolated V8 runtime
* KV storage uses tenant-{id}: prefixes for all keys
* R2 storage uses bucket-level or prefix-based separation
* Session management via Mcp-Session-Id headers with tenant validation
* Auto-scaling handled by Cloudflare's native edge distribution
* Cold start mitigation through keep-alive strategies and resource preloading

**Timestamp:** 2025-05-25

**Decision:**
* Adopt OAuth 2.1 + API Key Dual Authentication Strategy with 4-Layer Security Model

**Rationale:**
* OAuth 2.1 provides industry-standard authentication for human users with PKCE security
* API keys enable secure service-to-service communication for automated clients
* 4-layer security model (Network, Application, Runtime, Data) provides comprehensive defense-in-depth
* MCP protocol compliance ensures compatibility with MCP 2025-03-26 authorization specification
* Cloudflare's native security features (DDoS, WAF, TLS) provide robust network-level protection

**Context/Trigger:**
* SMCP-001-04 security strategy definition required comprehensive authentication and authorization approach
* Need to balance security, usability, and MCP protocol compliance
* Multi-tenant hosting requires robust isolation and access control mechanisms

**Implementation Notes:**
* OAuth 2.1: Full compliance with PKCE, dynamic client registration, metadata discovery
* API Keys: Tenant-scoped with format `smcp_<tenantId>_<randomBytes>` and automated rotation
* Secrets Management: Cloudflare encrypted environment variables + KV storage with AES-256-GCM
* Multi-tenant Isolation: V8 isolates + storage namespacing + tenant-scoped access controls
* Audit Logging: Comprehensive logging with tenant context and 30-day retention

**Timestamp:** 2025-05-25

**Decision:**
* Refactor .augment-guidelines File to Follow Augment Code Best Practices

**Rationale:**
* Research revealed that standard .augment-guidelines files use simple text format, not complex YAML structures
* Industry examples show preference for bullet-point lists with clear, actionable rules
* Original file was over-engineered with 210+ lines of template content that belonged elsewhere
* Simpler format improves readability and maintainability for AI assistant configuration
* Separation of concerns: guidelines for rules, memory-bank directory for templates

**Context/Trigger:**
* Side-task to research and align .augment-guidelines with Augment Code best practices
* Analysis of GitHub repositories using Augment Code showed simpler configuration patterns
* Need to optimize AI assistant configuration for better performance and clarity

**Implementation Notes:**
* Reduced file from 210 lines to 53 lines by removing embedded templates
* Converted complex YAML structure to simple markdown with bullet points
* Preserved memory-bank system functionality with clear references
* Added project-specific rules for POC-SMCP (security, Cloudflare, MCP development)
* Maintained all essential configuration while improving readability
* Template content moved to separate memory-bank directory structure

**Timestamp:** 2025-05-25
