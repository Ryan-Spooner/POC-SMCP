## Dependency Decisions Log

### 2025-05-25 - Cloudflare Workers as Primary Runtime
**Decision:** Use Cloudflare Workers exclusively for MCP server hosting
**Rationale:** Native HTTP support, global edge deployment, auto-scaling, built-in security
**Alternatives Considered:** AWS Lambda, Vercel Functions, traditional VPS hosting
**Impact:** Enables global performance, eliminates infrastructure management, reduces costs

### 2025-05-25 - TypeScript as Primary Language
**Decision:** Use TypeScript for all MCP server implementations
**Rationale:** Type safety, excellent tooling, native Cloudflare Workers support
**Alternatives Considered:** JavaScript only, Python (incompatible), Go (limited support)
**Impact:** Improved code quality, better developer experience, easier maintenance
