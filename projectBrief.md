- Create deployment automation and infrastructure-as-code patterns

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Core Features:**
  - MCP Server Hosting: Deploy and run MCP servers on Cloudflare Workers
  - Multi-tenant Isolation: Secure separation between different MCP server instances
  - Auto-scaling: Automatic scaling based on demand and usage patterns
  - Health Monitoring: Real-time monitoring and health checks for hosted servers
  - Deployment Pipeline: Automated deployment and management of MCP servers

- **User Stories:**
  - As an MCP server developer, I want to deploy my server to a secure hosting environment so that I can focus on development rather than infrastructure
  - As an AI application developer, I want to reliably connect to hosted MCP servers so that my applications have consistent access to MCP capabilities
  - As a platform administrator, I want to monitor and manage hosted MCP servers so that I can ensure security and performance

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Sub-500ms response times for MCP operations, sub-100ms infrastructure overhead
- **Security:** Complete tenant isolation, secure secrets management, DDoS protection via Cloudflare
- **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime, automatic failover, graceful error handling and recovery
- **Scalability:** Auto-scaling from 0 to high load, support for multiple concurrent MCP servers
- **Observability:** Comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing for all hosted services

### Technical Stack
- **Infrastructure:** Cloudflare Workers, Cloudflare KV, Cloudflare R2, Cloudflare DNS
- **Runtime:** JavaScript/TypeScript on Cloudflare Workers runtime
- **Deployment:** Wrangler CLI, Infrastructure as Code (Terraform or Pulumi)
- **Monitoring:** Cloudflare Analytics, custom metrics and logging
- **Development Tools:** TypeScript, Node.js, Wrangler, Git, CI/CD pipeline

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- **Platform:** Must use Cloudflare services as primary infrastructure
- **Timeline:** POC to be completed within 8 weeks
- **Resources:** Single developer (Ryan Spooner) available
- **Technology:** TypeScript/JavaScript runtime limitations of Cloudflare Workers

### Business Constraints
- **Cost:** Leverage Cloudflare's free tier where possible, minimize infrastructure costs
- **Security:** Must demonstrate enterprise-grade security isolation for future marketplace
- **Scalability:** Architecture must support future scaling to hundreds of MCP servers

### Assumptions
- **MCP Protocol:** MCP servers can be adapted to run in Cloudflare Workers environment
- **Technical:** Cloudflare Workers provide sufficient runtime capabilities for MCP hosting
- **Security:** Cloudflare's isolation model provides adequate multi-tenant security
- **Performance:** Cloudflare's global edge network will provide acceptable latency for MCP operations

## Risks & Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
- **MCP Protocol Compatibility:** MCP servers may not be compatible with Cloudflare Workers runtime - **Mitigation:** Early prototyping and testing with sample MCP servers
- **Security Isolation:** Cloudflare Workers isolation may be insufficient for multi-tenant hosting - **Mitigation:** Thorough security testing and additional isolation layers if needed

### Medium-Risk Items
- **Performance Limitations:** Cloudflare Workers cold start times may impact MCP response times - **Mitigation:** Implement keep-alive strategies and performance monitoring

## Out of Scope
